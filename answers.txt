1) When opening the party class, selecting all the lines of code, then pressing CTRL-I, 
Eclipse automatically properly indents the entire file according to commonly accepted stylistic
guidelines. When clicking file>>revert, it appears the file reverts back to the state it was in before
the file had been altered, at its most recent save point. This appears to be an effective way to revert accidental
changes or deletions made to the file after the file had been saved. 

2) When adding a breakpoint to the first line in showPeople, the program never enters the loop within the showPeople
function. When removing the first-line breakpoint and allowing the loop to continue with the print statement executing,
the object@memory_address is displayed by the "System.out.println(person)" line. This is because friends doesn't have a to.String()
method, so the memory location is being shown as opposed to the data stored in friends, which is the name of the friend as a string.

3) There is no .toString function in the friend class. There is no .toString() method being called in neither the Friend 
nor Party class.
